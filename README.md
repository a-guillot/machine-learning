# Machine Learning

The goal of this repository is to showcase some machine learning applications.
The main focus will be time series forecasting using Python3.

## Dataset

The dataset that is going to be used is [Mean summer temperature (in deg. C),
1781-1988]
(https://datamarket.com/data/set/22m7/mean-summer-temperature-in-deg-c-1781-1988#!ds=22m7&display=line).
I found it in the [Time Series Data Library](https://datamarket.com/data/list/?q=provider:tsdl),
a compilation of time series made by Rob Hyndman, Professor of Statistics at
Monash University, Australia.

This is what the dataset looks like:

This dataset only contains 208 values but I've chosen to use it because a simple
example will be easier to understand.
